# Challengemath
ChallengeMath ist a Python Script, that Build a Terminal Mental arithmetic game. It was completed by me within one Python module as a weekly task and offers at least small but nice fun on the side. Further development in the following modules or in my free time will certainly happen.

# Functions
- Numbers are randomly generated and a math operator is randomly selected
- The Name and the Score, will be safed in Highscore (Json)
- The game is repeated until you say that you don't want to continue after a correct answer
- Tasks can currently generate numbers from 0-100. This means that even super difficult mental arithmetic tasks can be generated, such as 92*36
